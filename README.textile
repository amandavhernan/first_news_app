h1. Documentation

This branch contains documentation created by Python's Sphinx framework.

It lives at "http://ireapps.github.com/first-news-app/":http://ireapps.github.com/first-news-app/

To update it, first make the desired revisions to the reStructuredText files in sphinx/source/. Then run "make html" from the sphinx directory. The files should update, and all that's required to publish is to commit the changes and run "git push origin gh-pages".
